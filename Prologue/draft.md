(dream/thought scene. will have to think about what keeps MC up at night)

"Yuki!...."

Those are thelast words i remember. everything after that is a blur, up until i was around 15 or 16... according to reports i found, i was involved in an incident with a Cardinal. Left this nasty scar, still hasnt fully healed after nearly half a decade. 

Rolling over i had a sudden flare up across my entire nervous system with pain.

"ARRRRGH, WHAT... THE" I couldnt help but groan out in agony at the sensation, my Scar was throbbing so intensely i think it'd burst open. 

Trying to calm down i focused my other senses on my surroundings. 


But things felt... wrong. The gentle whirring of fans or machinery where nowhere to be heard and the usual passing of feet in the hall. none, complete silence. 

attempting to get up with the pain in my abdomen was borderline impossible. but i neednt worry about that with the influx of Valkyries into my room. 

"Target found, Taking into custody" I distinctly heard one of them say. as i was man handled and basically kidnapped by a squad of women.

-An Unknown anmount of time later-

"Yuki, Im sorry we had to do it this way. The Research ship Fuusou had to scuttled, Our mother caused a right fucking mess now shes nowhere to be found" a Distinct Female voice spoke to me as i was bound and blindfolded

"What mess? last i heard she was trying to cure the Cardinal virus..." With those words i earned a swift slap on the face

"Cure the virus? she murdered nearly twenty five hundred children, Including yourself. HER OWN FUCKING CHILD" She yelled out ripping my blindfold off. revealing that it was my elder sister and Captain of the IJNC Amagi, 

standing with her uniform and signature Ponytail that all men adored and women were jealous of. 

"dont ask any questions. I'm sure she fed you a bunch of lies. you'll be under my care on the Amagi until we can find her and bring her to marshal for nothing short of crimes against humanity, as of now your under my command 2nd Leftenent Yuki"

I guess this is how my life on this ship begins, Under the command of my Elder sister, The Fearless Captain of IJNC Amagi, home of the Sentinal accademy, home of those that fight the virus and the monsters it creates
