The world of this story is based in the medium future during the 22nd centuary. long after a nuclear war that made most of europe uninhabitable. most people live in the americas, asia and on floating mega cities. known as fortresses to the public. 

but during the 2104 recession a disaster struck, a new pathogen broke out among mammals in the sount east of asia. turning all it infected into hideous creatures with abilities beyond humanities current understanding. some of the humans even gaining a metal like armour that was effective against traditional weapons. 


but researchers through unknown means developed a counter pathogen 'the "sentinal". when administered to humans gave them control over the pathogens, although the rate of sucess on men was deemed to be too low to risk treating them. with women being most suitable for becoming sentinals. 

but one male stood out among the test groups. the head researcher's own son of all people, this choice was like a conspiricy as it raised major ethical concerns even agmonst a deadly pandemic. 


The creatures are widely known as "Cardinals" while Sentinal Weilders are more often referred to as "valkyries" due to their equipment often giving long range light abilities. 


(BIG IDEA)

With one male being able to use the sentinal virus. theres a theory going round that his offspring with another sentinal may be more powerful than all current generations. 




The Cardinal Virus

A Virus from another world or should i say another reality brought to earth by none other than our MC's mum. 

The Sentinal Virus

A modified Cardinal virus more adapted to Humanity. currently only works on women. or its thought to.

During her "research" and lots of experimentation, resulting in nearly 2500 deaths of males of all ages.
